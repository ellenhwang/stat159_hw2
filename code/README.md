The code folder contains two scripts:

1. **eda-script.R** contains exploratory data analysis code. It computes some summary statistics and histograms between `TV` and `Sales`. 
2. **regression-script.R**: contains regression analysis code. It computes a regression object using `lm()` as well a summary of the regression using `summary()`. This script also creates a scatter plot overlaid with the regression line.
